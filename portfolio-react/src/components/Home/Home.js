                        <p>My name is Taylor Leong. I was originally born in California, but later moved to New York
                        in order to go to Barnard College. I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Biology, but
                        later decided to pursue further education related to coding. Or more specifically, learning
                        more about full-stack development. I can pick up new topics fairly quickly and always make 
                        time to study materials and finish work before their deadline.
