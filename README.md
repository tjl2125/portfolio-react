# Portfolio-react

## Description 
I have created a single-page website that acts as a deployed portfolio which
displays a small description about myself, examples of previous projects I had worked on, methods of 
contacting me, and a way of getting my resume. The website provides the basic information about myself
so that an employer can get an idea of what I am capable of doing and if I would be a good fit for their
business, as well as providing a way to look more into myself through my contacts and resume. I used some filler information on this website since I would prefer to not release some things about myself onto a public domain such as a copy of my resume.

## Credits
The Columbia Full-Stack Web Developer bootcamp provided guidance and taught me a lot. Google was also used often in order to find any other information.
